// Sequence is a state machine implementation that detects the sequence of event occurrences over time.
// All the consecutive events need to match the sequence condition, and there cannot be any
// non-matching events within a matching sequence of events. This can correlate events within a single stream
// or between multiple streams.
// In this example, the peaks in the temperature is detected using a sequence event variation. If the
// temperature is increasing (incoming events have higher temperature reading than the previous event's reading) and
// then decreasing (incoming events have lower temperature reading than the previous event's temperature reading), a
// peak temperature is in the middle.
