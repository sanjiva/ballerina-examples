//Ballerina programs are secure by design. They are inherently resilient 
//to major security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, path manipulation,
//file manipulation, unauthorized file access, and unvalidated
//redirect (open redirect).
//
//The Ballerina compiler has the ability to perform comprehensive
//taint analysis. It identifies untrusted (tainted) data by
// observing how tainted data propagates through the program. 
//If untrusted data is passed to a security sensitive parameter, it generates errors.
