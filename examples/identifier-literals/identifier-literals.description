//Ballerina supports identifier literals. This means that it is possible to define
//symbols without any of the usual restrictions that restrict whitespaces, special characters, etc. 

//Ballerina allows identifiers to contain spaces and use any set of Unicode code points.

//Identifiers can be used for names, functions, services, structs, variables, etc.
//In Ballerina, identifiers are defined as "traditional" identifiers or identifier literals.
