// Timers are used to execute tasks periodically. A timer may have an initial delay and interval specified.
// The delay specifies the delay between registering the task and its first execution. Thereafter, the timer 
// goes off at regular intervals. A trigger function is called when the timer goes off. If a failure occurs during
// the execution of the trigger function, it returns an error, which is passed to the 'onError' function.
