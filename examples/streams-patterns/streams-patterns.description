// Streaming patterns are state machine implementations that allow you to detect patterns in the events that arrive
// over time. These can correlate events within a single stream or between multiple streams.
// In this example, streaming rules send the stop control action to the regulator when the key is removed from the hotel
// room given that the regulator is switched on prior to removing the hotel key.
