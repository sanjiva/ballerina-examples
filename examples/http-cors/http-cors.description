//This sample demonstrates the Ballerina server connector CORS configuration. 
//CORS headers can be applied in both the service and resouce levels. Service-level CORS headers apply to all resources 
//unless the headers are configured at the resource-level. Ballerina CORS supports both simple and pre-flight requests.
