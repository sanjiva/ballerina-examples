//Ternary is a conditional operator that can be used as a shortcut to an if-else statement.
//It evaluates a condition and chooses one of two branches to execute.
//
//The ternary operator takes three operands and uses the '?' and ':' symbols to form it. Syntax:
//      condition ? trueExpression : falseExpression
