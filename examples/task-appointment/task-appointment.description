// An appointment is a task that is executed on clock time. Cron syntax is used to define the time, and in
// case of recurring appointments, the frequency of the appointment.
// A trigger function is called when an appointment is due. If a failure occurs during
// the execution of the trigger function, it returns an error, which is passed to the 'onError' function.
