//XML to JSON conversion can be done using the `toJSON` function. This function 
//takes the XML to be converted, and the struct of options, as arguments. The options 
//struct has two fields: The `attributePrefix` field specifies the prefix added to XML 
//attributes/namespace keys (the default value is `@`), and the `preserveNamespaces` field specifies 
//whether to preserve namespace prefixes during conversion.
