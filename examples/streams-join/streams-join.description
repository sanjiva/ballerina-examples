//Streams can be joined using a streaming query logic.
//In this example, events related to raw materials and production output wait for 10 seconds and then correlates the
// data gathered during that time period. An alert is triggered if the raw material usage is 5% higher than the
// production outcome. This example can be extended to make decisions based on the output of the streaming rules.
